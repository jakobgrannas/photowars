# photowars
A silly game to kill people by taking a picture of them

## How to run

Install Expo (www.expo.io) to run react native apps without having to go through app store

`npm install expo-cli --global`

Install local dependencies

`npm install`

Run the app

`npm start`

Expo will now create a proxy for you so that you can access the PhotoWars app through the Expo app.

## Run on an actual device (optional)
1. Go into the app store and download the Expo app. You might need to create an account.
2. Open the app and go to `Projects`. If the app is showing up, just click to launch it. Otherwise either open your camera app and scan the QR code showing in the terminal, or browse to the `expo://` url mentioned in the console. 
If the app still doesn't work or show up not make sure your phone and computer are on the same network.
